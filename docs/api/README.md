# Web API

Trento exposes a web API both for internal and public usage.
All of the available endpoints are defined and documented via the [OpenAPI 2.0 specification](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/) (a.k.a. Swagger).

Once you have the Trento Server running, you can browse the automatically generated documentation page at `/api/docs/index.html`, and the JSON specification at `/api/docs/doc.json`.

We might also have some other API endpoints which could be documented elsewhere, for development purposes only, but please disregard any functionality that is not included in the above specification, as this would mean it is not intended for external usage.
