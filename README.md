# Trento

An open cloud-native web console improving on the life of SAP Applications administrators.

_Trento is a city on the Adige River in Trentino-Alto Adige/SÃ¼dtirol in Italy. [...] It is one of the nation's wealthiest and most prosperous cities, [...] often ranking highly among Italian cities for quality of life, standard of living, and business and job opportunities._ ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trento))

This project is a reboot of the "SUSE Console for SAP Applications", also known as the [Blue Horizon for SAP](https://github.com/SUSE/blue-horizon-for-sap) prototype, which is focused on automated infrastructure deployment and provisioning for SAP Applications.

As opposed to that first iteration, this new one will focus more on operations of existing clusters, rather than deploying new one.
