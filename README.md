# Trento

An open cloud-native web console improving on the life of SAP Applications
administrators.

_Trento is a city on the Adige River in Trentino-Alto Adige/SÃ¼dtirol in Italy.
[...] It is one of the nation's wealthiest and most prosperous cities, [...]
often ranking highly among Italian cities for quality of life, standard of
living, and business and job opportunities._ ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trento))

This project is a reboot of the "SUSE Console for SAP Applications", also known
as the [Blue Horizon for SAP](https://github.com/SUSE/blue-horizon-for-sap)
prototype, which is focused on automated infrastructure deployment and
provisioning for SAP Applications.

As opposed to that first iteration, this new one will focus more on operations
of existing clusters, rather than deploying new one.

## Features

T.B.D.

## Requirements

To build the entire application you will need the following dependencies:

- Go ^1.16
- Node.js ^15.x

## Installation

This project is in development so, for the time being, you need to clone it and
build it manually:

```shell
git clone github.com/trento-project/trento.git
cd trento
make build
```

Pre-built binaries will be available soon.

## Usage

You can start the web application as follows:

```shell
./trento web serve
```

The web application needs one or more agents registered against against Consul
(https://consul.io/). A consul server needs to be paired with the Trento Web
Application.

Each agent node also needs a consul agent started. Follow the
[Running An Agent](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent#running-an-agent) steps for
starting it prior running the Trento Agent.

The Trento agent can then be started:

```shell
./trento agent start -n $name examples/azure-rules.yaml
```

See the [Deployment Architecture](./docs/trento-architecture.md) for details.

## Tagging the systems

In order to group and filter the systems a tagging mechanism can be used. This tags are placed as
meta-data in the agent nodes. Find information about how to set meta-data in the agents at: https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/options#node_meta

As an example, check the [meta-data file][./examples/trento-config.json] file. This file must be
located in the folder set as `-config-dir` during the agent execution.

The next items are reserved:
- `trento-sap-environment`: Environment in which the system is running
- `trento-sap-landscape`: Landscape in which the system is running
- `trento-sap-environment`: SAP system (composed by database and application) in which the system is running

### Setting the tags from the KV storage

These reserved tags can be automatically set and updated using the [consul-template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template).
To achieve this, the tags information will come from the KV storage.

Set the metadata in the next paths:
- `trento/nodename/metadata/sap-environment`
- `trento/nodename/metadata/sap-landscape`
- `trento/nodename/metadata/sap-system`

Notice that a new entry must exists for every node.
After that, run the `consul-template` tool with:
`./consul-template -consul-addr=http://consul-host:8500 -template "examples/trento-config.tpl:consul.d/test/trento-config.json:./consul reload -http-addr=http://consul-host:8500"`

### Filtering the nodes in the wep app

The web app provides the option to filter the systems using the previously commented reserved tags. To achieve this, the tags must be stored in the KV storage.
Use the next path:
- `trento/filters/sap-environments`
- `trento/filters/sap-landscapes`
- `trento/filters/sap-systems`

Each of them must have a json list format. As example: `["land1", "land2"]`.
These entries will be available in the filters on the `/environments` page.

## Development

We use GNU Make as a task manager; here are some common targets:

```shell
make # clean, test and build everything

make clean # removes any build artifact
make test # executes all the tests
make fmt # fixes code formatting
make web-assets # invokes the frontend build scripts
make generate # refresh automatically generated code (e.g. static Go mocks)
```

Feel free to peek at the [Makefile](Makefile) to know more.

> **Note**  
> The [`mockery`](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) tool is required for the `generate` target, which in turn is required for the `test` target.
> You can install it with `go install github.com/vektra/mockery/v2@latest`
